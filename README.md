# css-examples

Code examples that accompany various MDN CSS documentation pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can include an example directly in MDN pages using [`{{EmbedLiveSample()}}` macros](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Macros/Commonly_used_macros#code_samples) or regular Markdown code blocks.
> These methods are simpler to maintain as the code lives beside the rest of the content.
> Only add examples to this repository if your example doesn't easily run on MDN pages for technical or security reasons.

The "animation-frames-timing-function" directory contains a simple example that demonstrates the difference between the steps() timing function available for CSS animations and transitions, and the new frames() timing function. [Run the example live](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/animation-frames-timing-function/). You can also find versions that show the same timing function [used with transitions](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/animation-frames-timing-function/index-transitions.html), and used with the [Web Animations API](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/animation-frames-timing-function/index-waa.html).

The "counter-style-demo" directory contains a demo for the [@counter-style documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style). See the live demo [here](https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/counter-style-demo/).

The "moz-context-properties" directory contains a demo for the [-moz-context-properties documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-context-properties). See the live demo [here](https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/moz-context-properties/).

The "editable-examples" directory contains CSS examples that are intended to be embedded in MDN pages as live editable samples.

The "object-fit-basics" directory contains a simple page demonstrating typical usage of different `object-fit` and `object-position` values. [Run example live](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/object-fit-basics/).

The "object-fit-gallery" directory contains a fun image gallery that uses `object-fit` to display the images more nicely, both in thumbnail and full size view. [Run the example live](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/object-fit-gallery/).

The "overscroll-behavior" directory contains a simple page demonstrating typical usage of different `overscroll-behavior` values. [Run example live](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/overscroll-behavior/).

The "tools" directory contains various tools for working with CSS, including a [color picker](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/tools/color-picker/) and a [box shadow generator](http://mdn.github.io/css-examples/tools/box-shadow-generator/).
