# Overflow tasks

The following tasks aim to help students test their knowledge of the `overflow` property.

## Task 1

In this task there is overflowing text content and the student is asked to cause the box to have scrollbars if there is too much content. They should use `overflow: auto` as then the box will only gain scrollbars when the content is too large.

```css
.box {
  overflow: auto;
}
```

## Task 2

In this task an image is overflowing and the student is asked to crop all of the image that is outside of the box. They should therefore use `overflow: hidden`.

```css
.box {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
